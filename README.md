# Prasunet Company Cyber Security Internship

Welcome to my Cyber Security Internship projects at Prasunet Company! Below are the tasks I have been assigned during this internship.

## Task 01: Implement Caesar Cipher
Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

## Task 02: Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption
Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. You can perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying basic or mathematical operations to each pixel. Allow users to encrypt and decrypt images.

## Task 03: Password Complexity Checker
Build a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Provide feedback to users on the password's strength.

## Task 04: Simple Keylogger
Create a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. Focus on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file. Note: Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving keyloggers.

## Task 05: Network Packet Analyzer
Develop a packet sniffer tool that captures and analyzes network packets. Display relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data. Ensure the ethical use of the tool for educational purposes.
